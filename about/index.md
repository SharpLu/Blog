Hi,

I’m a big data engineer and researcher, interested in programming and development. The majority of topics focused on distributed systems, programming, and big data technologies. I decided to "Blogging" is inspired by "Jeff Atwood" from his post After the inner struggle and my heart advice me maybe it’s time to “try blogging”. 

Reference from "Jeff Atwood"
>When people ask me for advice on blogging, I always respond with yet another form of the same advice: pick a schedule you can live with, and stick to it. Until you do that, none of the other advice I could give you will matter. I don't care if you suck at writing. I don't care if nobody reads your blog. I don't care if you have nothing interesting to say. If you can demonstrate a willingness to write, and a desire to keep continually improving your writing, you will eventually be successful.

I have been a big data engineer for years, but still, haven’t broken through the bottleneck of my abilities. Helplessly, technologies iteration is too fast and so many stuff needs to catch up and hopefully, my blog will be utilized.

Why do you blog?
