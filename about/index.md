Hi

I am a big data engineer with extensive practice in big data industry and
computer science, I have created this blog that could force me to written things
down of what I have learned in the spare-time. The majorities articles is about
Programming/Algorithms/ Big Data/Distributed Systems/Machine Learning. Since I
start to write article is 2014 during those years I noticed that is
significantly helpful for memory and understanding the technologies, because as
a programmer you need to learn a lot of things the documentation you learn
things could help to deepen impression of your memory. Of Course minority
articles it may be shallow I always welcome feedbacks.

 

Currently I’m working on leaked database project in my spare time.
