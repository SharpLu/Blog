Hi,

I’m a big data engineer and researcher, interested in programming and development. The majority of topics focused on distributed systems, programming, and big data technologies. I decided to "Blogging" is inspired by "Jeff Atwood" from his post<How To Achieve Ultimate Blog Success In One Easy Step> After the inner struggle and my heart advice me maybe it’s time to “try blogging”. Even I have been a big data engineer for years, but still, haven’t broken through the bottleneck of my abilities. Helplessly, technologies iteration is too fast and so many stuff needs to catch up and hopefully mu blog will utilized.
