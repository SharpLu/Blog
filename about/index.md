Hi,

I’m Feng and a big data engineer and researcher, interested in programming and development. The majority of topics focused on distributed systems, programming, big data technologies and block chain. 

Why do you blog?
----------
I decided to "Blogging" mostly for selfish reasons. As a engineer you need the way to tracking of the technologies and algorithms, because you can't remember everything you learned and practiced. Sometimes you spend few days on a specific bug without conclusion and notes when the problem occurs again maybe you need to spend same time on it. Weanwhile it could be helpful for other people who experienced the same problem. You have to admit your memeory just like a cache system you have no idea when it will be clear up. The blog could help you yo persistent the all memory to disk whenever you need it, you always could find it. Also starting to blogging is inspired by "Jeff Atwood" from his post "How To Achieve Ultimate Blog Success In One Easy Step" After the inner struggle and my intuition push me maybe it’s time to “try blogging”.

I have been a big data engineer for years, but still, haven’t broken through the bottleneck of my abilities. Helplessly, technologies iteration is too fast and so many stuff needs to catch up and hopefully, my blog will be utilized.
Advice from "Jeff Atwood"
When people ask me for advice on blogging, I always respond with yet another form of the same advice: pick a schedule you can live with, and stick to it. Until you do that, none of the other advice I could give you will matter. I don't care if you suck at writing. I don't care if nobody reads your blog. I don't care if you have nothing interesting to say. If you can demonstrate a willingness to write, and a desire to keep continually improving your writing, you will eventually be successful.
