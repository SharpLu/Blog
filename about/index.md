Hi,

I’m a big data engineer and researcher, interested in programming and development. The majority of topics focused on distributed systems, programming, and big data technologies. Even I have been a big data engineer for years, but still, haven’t broken through the bottleneck of my abilities. Helplessly, technologies iteration is too fast and so many stuff needs to catch up and you can’t remember all the stuff you learned. After reading the post from “Jeff Atwood “ «How To Achieve Ultimate Blog Success In One Easy Step» and the inner struggle that advice me maybe it’s time to “try re-blogging”.
