Hi,

I'm a big data engineer and researcher, interested on programming and development. The majority topics focused on distributed systems, programming and big data technogies. Even I have been a big data engineer for years, but still haven't breakthrough the bottleneck of my abilities. Helplessly, technologies iteration is too fast and so many stuff needs to catch up and you can't remember all the stuff you learned. After read the post from "Jeff Atwood " <<How To Achieve Ultimate Blog Success In One Easy Step>> and the inner struggle  that advice me maybe it's time to "try re-blogging".
